it-edit (3.0) All; urgency=low

  * Implementing more user asking simple and practical functionalities.

    * Note that all are configurable from the user, as you want your editor behaves:


  * You can be warn if a file is currently loaded into the editor and you try to load it again.

      * you can choose to load it or not.


  * You can be warn by closing an unsaved file !

      * That's nothing special but personaly I dislike this behaviour strangely.

      * So it's configurable to enable or disable this feature.

  * You can be warn before "really quit" when you quit using the shortcut or the menu item.

    * You can choose to really quit the application or not, because the shortcut (Ctrl + Q)
    * Can be dangerous in some circumstances (the 'Q' is aside the 'S' on an AZERTY keyboard).

  * You can be warn when you open a file which is "read-only" for the user which open it.

    * The file can be "read-only" for many reasons but the consequence is
    * that the user won't be able to save tthe file as it's opened location.


  * I failed to implement a warning when a file is modified from an extern process.

    * In fact I success to implement it but it has strange behaviour what,
    * I don't really understand and what can be very disturbing.

    * I think the library isn't able to reconize that your process has change the file.

  * The warning by closing the application when files still unsaved is already present.

      * On which the menu items are based on.

      * On which the simple icon buttons are based on.

        * A button contains only a image and a optional shortcut formatted tooltip.

it-edit (3.0) All; urgency=high

  * Integration of a spell checker using the library gspell-1.

    * Marking all misspell words into the editor.

    * Display a dialog for correct all misppelled words.

  * @NOTES -> The gspell-1 library present 2 major problems for me:

      * gspell-1 is a young library so it will not be present on every distribution.

      * gspell-1 provides no version MACRO so i I can't include some code conditionally.
      * Currently I get the version on 1.0 but the version 1.1
      * provides a language chooser into the Dialog for spellchecking.

    * The gspell library has the advantages to be fully compatible with the libgtksourceview-3.0 library.
